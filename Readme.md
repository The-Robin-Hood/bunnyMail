# 🐰 BunnyMail

A minimalist email client built with PyQt5. It doesn't love you, it just works. Mostly.

## Why ?
 - For fuck's sake why not ? Every email client i feel it's just bloated 
 - You rarely send emails of consequence. You definitely don't need a calendar, a chat feature, or an AI integrated project management suite to look at spam and bills. 
 - BunnyMail respects your low-effort lifestyle.

## Features
- Fucking nothing yet done

## Requirements
- Python: Install it. You know how.
- Dependencies: Consult [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt). 
- If you can't figure out a simple `pip install -r requirements.txt` command, perhaps you should stick to webmail.

## Installation
- Clone this repository. If you don't know Git, Google it. I'm not your tech support.
- Run the requirements command.
- Execute the main file. If you need step-by-step instructions on running a Python script, you are the reason we can't have nice things.
