# 🐰 BunnyMail

A minimalist email client built with PyQt5. It doesn't love you, it just works. Mostly.

## Why ?
 - For fuck's sake why not ? Every email client i feel it's just bloated 
 - You rarely send emails of consequence. You definitely don't need a calendar, a chat feature, or an AI integrated project management suite to look at spam and bills. 
 - BunnyMail respects your low-effort lifestyle.
